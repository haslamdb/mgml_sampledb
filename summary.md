# MGML Sample Database Improvements

I've made extensive improvements to your Django project for tracking laboratory samples. Here's a summary of the changes:

## 1. Security Enhancements
- Moved sensitive information (database credentials, secret key) to environment variables
- Added a `.env` file to store these variables (remember to add this to .gitignore)
- Set up python-decouple for environment variable management

## 2. Model Improvements
- Added a `TimeStampedModel` abstract class for tracking creation and modification times
- Added user tracking to see who created and last modified each sample
- Added validators for barcodes and other fields
- Enhanced relationships between models with better related names
- Added more fields for comprehensive data collection
- Added indexes to frequently queried fields for better performance
- Improved model documentation with docstrings and help_text

## 3. Class-Based Views
- Replaced function-based views with class-based views
- Implemented proper view hierarchy with inheritance
- Added LoginRequiredMixin for authentication
- Added proper success messages
- Implemented detail views for all sample types
- Added search functionality across all sample types

## 4. Dashboard
- Created a comprehensive dashboard view
- Added statistics for each sample type
- Implemented visualizations of sample distribution
- Added "awaiting sequencing" count
- Added recent samples list for quick access

## 5. Admin Interface Improvements
- Enhanced admin panel with better list displays
- Added custom actions like "mark as archived"
- Implemented proper fieldsets for better organization
- Added custom filters and search
- Added relationship counts (number of aliquots, extracts, etc.)
- Added clickable links to parent samples

## 6. Forms and Validation
- Added comprehensive validation for all form fields
- Improved form field widgets with better HTML5 elements
- Added cross-field validation (e.g., collection date before create date)
- Enhanced selectpicker for better dropdown selection
- Added help text for form fields

## 7. Template Improvements
- Added search results template
- Added detailed view templates for each sample type
- Enhanced base template with better navigation
- Added dashboard template with visualization placeholders

## 8. Project Structure
- Created requirements.txt file
- Added proper README.md with installation and usage instructions
- Organized URLs better with descriptive names

## 9. Logging
- Added comprehensive logging configuration
- Logs to both file and console
- Different log levels for development and production

## 10. Development and Deployment
- Added static files configuration
- Set up proper settings for development and production
- Added gunicorn to requirements for production deployment

## Next Steps
1. **Set up user roles and permissions** - Consider adding role-based access control
2. **Add batch operations** - For processing multiple samples at once
3. **Implement API** - Using Django REST Framework for mobile or external applications
4. **Add sample history tracking** - Using django-simple-history
5. **Set up automated testing** - Write unit and integration tests
6. **Create data export functionality** - CSV/Excel export of sample data
7. **Implement barcode generation/scanning** - For easy sample identification
8. **Add email notifications** - For important events (e.g., sequencing complete)

## Installation Instructions
1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Create a `.env` file with the necessary environment variables
3. Run database migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
4. Create a superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
5. Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`
