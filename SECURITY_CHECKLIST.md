## 🚨 Implementation Guide

### Phase 1: Immediate Deployment (0-1 day)
```bash
# 1. Backup current system
sudo systemctl stop mgml_sampledb  # if currently running
cp -r /var/www/mgml_sampledb /var/www/mgml_sampledb_backup

# 2. Update the application code (already done)
# The optimized views.py is ready to deploy

# 3. Test the application
python manage.py check --deploy
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

# 4. Restart services
sudo systemctl start mgml_sampledb
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Phase 2: Security Hardening (1-2 days)
```bash
# 1. Install security dependencies
pip install -r requirements_secure.txt

# 2. Update settings to use security_config.py
# Add to settings.py: from .security_config import *

# 3. Configure middleware
# Add custom middleware to MIDDLEWARE setting

# 4. Run security audit
python manage.py security_audit --days 7
```

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Security (2-3 days)
```bash
# 1. Run the secure deployment script
chmod +x deploy_secure.sh
./deploy_secure.sh

# 2. Configure SSL certificates
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
