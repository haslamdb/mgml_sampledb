# üîí Security Checklist for Public Repository

## ‚úÖ Pre-Publication Security Audit

### Database Security
- [ ] **Database is NOT in repository**: MySQL database lives only on your server
- [ ] **No database dumps**: No `.sql` files with real data in the repository
- [ ] **No database credentials**: All credentials are in `.env` (which is gitignored)
- [ ] **Database access restricted**: Only accessible from localhost/server

### Environment & Secrets
- [ ] **`.env` file is gitignored**: Contains all sensitive configuration
- [ ] **`.env.example` provided**: Template for others to set up their own environment
- [ ] **No hardcoded secrets**: All secrets use environment variables
- [ ] **Secret keys generated uniquely**: Each deployment has its own SECRET_KEY

### File Protection
- [ ] **Virtual environment excluded**: `venv/`, `bin/`, `lib/` are gitignored
- [ ] **Log files excluded**: `*.log`, `logs/` directory gitignored
- [ ] **Production configs excluded**: Server-specific files gitignored
- [ ] **Backup files excluded**: Any `*_backup.*` files gitignored

### Code Review
- [ ] **No patient data in code**: No real names, IDs, or medical info in source
- [ ] **No IP addresses**: Server IPs not hardcoded in public code
- [ ] **No internal URLs**: Internal server addresses not exposed
- [ ] **Comments reviewed**: No sensitive info in code comments

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Measures

### Server Security (Not in Repository)
- [ ] **Firewall configured**: Only necessary ports open (80, 443, SSH)
- [ ] **SSH key authentication**: Password authentication disabled
- [ ] **Regular updates**: Server OS and packages kept updated
- [ ] **SSL certificates**: HTTPS enabled with valid certificates

### Database Security (Not in Repository)
- [ ] **Strong passwords**: Database uses complex passwords
- [ ] **User permissions**: Database user has minimal required permissions
- [ ] **Regular backups**: Automated backups to secure location
- [ ] **Access logging**: Database access is logged and monitored

### Application Security
- [ ] **ALLOWED_HOSTS configured**: Only trusted domains allowed
- [ ] **DEBUG=False in production**: Debug mode disabled in production
- [ ] **CSRF protection enabled**: Cross-site request forgery protection active
- [ ] **Session security**: Secure session cookies configured

## üìã What's Safe to Make Public

### ‚úÖ Safe to Share
- Django application code (`models.py`, `views.py`, etc.)
- HTML templates (without real data)
- CSS and JavaScript files
- Requirements files (`requirements.txt`)
- Documentation files (`.md` files)
- Configuration templates (`.env.example`)
- Static assets (logos, CSS, JS)

### ‚ùå Never Share Publicly
- `.env` file with real credentials
- Database files or dumps with real data
- Log files with user activity
- SSL certificates and private keys
- Server configuration with real IPs/domains
- Backup files with real data

## üöÄ Steps to Make Repository Public

### 1. Final Security Check
```bash
# Review what will be published
git ls-files | head -20

# Check for any sensitive data
grep -r "password\|secret\|key" . --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=venv --exclude-dir=logs

# Verify .env is not tracked
git ls-files | grep "\.env$"  # Should return nothing
```

### 2. Clean Commit History (Optional)
If you ever committed sensitive data, you may want to clean the history:
```bash
# Check commit history for sensitive files
git log --name-only | grep -E "(\.env$|secret|password)"

# If found, consider using git filter-branch or BFG Repo-Cleaner
```

### 3. Update Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with public-friendly description
- [ ] Remove any internal server references
- [ ] Add clear setup instructions for new users
- [ ] Include security best practices

### 4. Repository Settings
- [ ] Set repository to public on GitHub
- [ ] Add appropriate license (MIT, GPL, etc.)
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning

## üéØ Benefits of Making Repository Public

### For the Community
- Other labs can benefit from your LIMS system
- Peer review improves code quality
- Potential contributions from other developers
- Transparency in scientific software

### For Your Lab
- Professional portfolio piece
- Easier collaboration with external developers
- Community support and bug reports
- Potential funding opportunities

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders

1. **Your database is completely separate** from the Git repository
2. **Patient data never leaves your server** - it's not in the code
3. **Each installation is independent** - others create their own databases
4. **You control access to your server** - GitHub access ‚â† database access

## üîç Ongoing Security Practices

- Regularly review commits before pushing
- Use GitHub's security alerts for dependencies
- Keep your server and application updated
- Monitor access logs for unusual activity
- Backup your database regularly (to secure location)

**Remember**: Making your code public does NOT expose your database or patient data. They are completely separate systems!
