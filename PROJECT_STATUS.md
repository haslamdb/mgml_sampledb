# MGML Sample Database - Project Status

## Last Updated: September 19, 2025 - 9:35 PM

## ‚úÖ Recent Accomplishments (Latest Session - Evening Part 2)

### Sequence Library Improvements (September 19, 2025 - 9:00 PM)
- **Comprehensive Library Type System with 45+ Methods**
  - Added detailed library preparation methods across 5 categories:
    - Metagenomics (13 methods)
    - Metatranscriptomics (9 methods)
    - Bulk RNA-seq (5 methods)
    - Single-cell RNA-seq (9 methods)
    - Specialized RNA-seq (5 methods)
  - Each method has a unique 2-letter suffix for file naming (e.g., NX for Nextera XT)
  - Default library type: Nextera XT

- **Sequence Filename Generation System**
  - Format: `{base_id}_{library_suffix}_R1/R2.fastq.gz`
  - Example: `IS-250919-001_NX_R1.fastq.gz` for Nextera XT library
  - **Legacy filename priority**: Imported samples with legacy_sequence_filename use original names
  - Critical for cross-referencing with existing data and metadata

- **Enhanced Sequence File Display**
  - SequenceLibrary detail page now shows:
    - R1 and R2 filenames
    - Legacy filename (if imported)
    - Data file location
  - Advanced filter exports include sequence filenames in CSV
  - Visual indicator for libraries with generated files

- **Library Type Filtering**
  - Added library_type filter to Advanced Filter interface
  - Can filter sequence libraries by preparation method
  - All 45+ library types available in dropdown

### UI/UX Refinements (September 19, 2025 - 9:20 PM)
- **Home Page Reorganization**

  - Better prioritization of frequently used features

- **Terminology Update**
  - Changed "Patient Type" to "Patient Group" throughout
  - Better reflects study cohorts/groups rather than individual types
  - Updated in models, forms, templates, and CSV exports

## ‚úÖ Recent Accomplishments (Latest Session - Evening Part 1)

### UI/UX Improvements (September 19, 2025 - Evening)
- **Renamed "Crude Sample" to "Parent Sample"** throughout the application
  - Updated all models' verbose names
  - Modified all templates and forms
  - Changed navigation menus and headers
  - Note: Database model class remains `CrudeSample` for backward compatibility

- **Enhanced Extract List View**
  - Removed "Quality Score" column
  - Added "Concentration (ng/¬µL)" column for better lab workflow visibility

- **Added Reports Section to Home Page**
  - Quick access buttons to view all samples by type
  - Direct links to comprehensive reports and advanced filtering
  - Improved navigation for lab staff

- **Fixed Search Results Display**
  - Corrected Sample ID column to show actual sample_id instead of subject_id
  - Format now properly shows: ST-250924-CR style IDs

### Legacy Sample Import System (September 19, 2025 - Evening)
- **Created comprehensive import system for thousands of legacy samples**
  - Built management command: `python manage.py import_legacy_samples`
  - Supports CSV import with extensive metadata fields
  - Handles missing data gracefully
  - Creates full sample hierarchy (CrudeSample ‚Üí Aliquot ‚Üí Extract ‚Üí SequenceLibrary)

- **Added project tracking fields to all sample models**:
  - `project_name` - Text field for project identification
  - `investigator` - Principal investigator name
  - `patient_type` - Patient category/type
  - `study_id` - Study identifier

- **Added legacy support to SequenceLibrary**:
  - `legacy_sequence_filename` - Original filename from legacy system
  - `data_file_location` - Path to data files
  - `is_legacy_import` - Boolean flag for imported samples
  - Smart `get_sequence_filenames()` method that returns legacy name or generates new format

- **Import template includes**:
  - subject_id, collection_date (required)
  - legacy_sequence_filename, project_name, investigator, patient_type, study_id
  - sample_source, isolate_source (for bacterial isolates), barcode
  - n_index, s_index, library_type, sequencing_date, sequencing_platform
  - notes, data_file_location
  - Isolate source tracking added for imports (Blood, Urine, Wound, etc.)
  - See `import_template.csv` for example format with isolate samples

### Advanced Filtering System (September 19, 2025 - Evening)
- **Created comprehensive filtering interface** (`/advanced-filter/`)
  - Filter by sample type (Parent Samples, Aliquots, Extracts, Libraries)
  - Filter by project metadata (project name, investigator, patient type, study ID)
  - Filter by sample source and isolate source
  - Date range filtering
  - Legacy sample filtering option
  - Three export formats: View, CSV, Label Printing

- **Quick Create Workflow for Aliquots**

  - Auto-generates barcodes for plate storage
  - Accessible via "Quick Create" button on home page
  - Useful for immediate sample processing

### Isolate Source Tracking (September 19, 2025 - Evening)
- **Added isolate_source field to CrudeSample model**
  - Options: Blood, Urine, Wound, Stool, Laboratory, Other
  - Only applies when sample_source is "Isolate"
  - Conditional field display in forms
  - Searchable and filterable in advanced filter
  - Included in CSV imports

### Export Improvements (September 19, 2025 - Evening)
- **Updated CSV export for label printing**
  - First column: sample_id (e.g., ST-250924-CR)
  - Second column: subject_id
  - Third column: barcode
  - Better format for lab label generation

### Sample ID System Implementation (September 19, 2025 - Morning)
- **Implemented hierarchical sample ID system** with format: `[SourceType]-[Date]-[Seq]-[SampleType]`
  - SourceType: Two-letter code (e.g., IS for Isolate, ST for Stool)
  - Date: YYMMDD format
  - Seq: Daily sequence counter (001, 002, etc.)
  - SampleType: CS (Crude Sample), AL (Aliquot), EX (Extract), SL (Sequence Library)
- **Added 'Isolate' as new sample source** with code 'IS'
- **Updated all 14 existing samples** from 'Other' to 'Isolate' type
- **Generated unique sample IDs** for all existing samples:
  - 15 CrudeSamples with sample_ids
  - 14 Aliquots with sample_ids
  - 14 Extracts with sample_ids
- **Fixed Django migration issues** and restored database consistency

### Database Migration Recovery (September 19, 2025)
- Resolved corrupted migration history
- Cleaned up phantom model fields
- Re-synchronized Django models with database schema
- Successfully applied new migrations for sample ID system
