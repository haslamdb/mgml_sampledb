# MGML Sample Database - Project Status

## Last Updated: September 19, 2025

## ‚úÖ Recent Accomplishments

### Sample ID System Implementation (September 19, 2025)
- **Implemented hierarchical sample ID system** with format: `[SourceType]-[Date]-[Seq]-[SampleType]`
  - SourceType: Two-letter code (e.g., IS for Isolate, ST for Stool)
  - Date: YYMMDD format
  - Seq: Daily sequence counter (001, 002, etc.)
  - SampleType: CS (Crude Sample), AL (Aliquot), EX (Extract), SL (Sequence Library)
- **Added 'Isolate' as new sample source** with code 'IS'
- **Updated all 14 existing samples** from 'Other' to 'Isolate' type
- **Generated unique sample IDs** for all existing samples:
  - 15 CrudeSamples with sample_ids
  - 14 Aliquots with sample_ids
  - 14 Extracts with sample_ids
- **Fixed Django migration issues** and restored database consistency

### Database Migration Recovery (September 19, 2025)
- Resolved corrupted migration history
- Cleaned up phantom model fields
- Re-synchronized Django models with database schema
- Successfully applied new migrations for sample ID system

## üìä Current Database Status

### Sample Inventory
- **CrudeSamples**: 15 (all Isolate type)
- **Aliquots**: 14
- **Extracts**: 14
- **SequenceLibraries**: 0

### Sample ID Examples
```
CrudeSample: IS-250812-001-CS
‚îî‚îÄ Aliquot: IS-250812-001-AL-1
   ‚îî‚îÄ Extract: IS-250812-001-EX-1
```

### Available Sample Sources
1. Stool (ST)
2. Oral Swab (OR)
3. Nasal Swab (NA)
4. Skin Swab (SK)
5. Blood (BL)
6. Tissue (TI)
7. **Isolate (IS)** - *NEW*
8. Other (OT)

## üîß System Configuration

### Database
- **Engine**: MySQL
- **Database**: mgml_sampledb
- **Tables**: All sampletracking tables include base_id and sample_id fields

### Key Models
- `CrudeSample` - Initial samples with auto-generated sample IDs
- `Aliquot` - Derived from CrudeSamples, inherits base_id
- `Extract` - Derived from Aliquots, inherits base_id
- `SequenceLibrary` - Derived from Extracts, inherits base_id

### Historical Tracking
- All models use Django Simple History for audit trails
- Historical tables mirror main tables with base_id and sample_id

## üìù TODO List

### Completed ‚úÖ
- [x] **Generate Sample Reports** (September 19, 2025)
  - [x] Created `generate_sample_report.py` script
  - [x] Report lists all samples by type with full metadata:
    - Barcode, Sample ID, Base ID
    - Creation date, Subject ID
    - Collection date (for CrudeSamples)
    - Parent relationships
    - Storage location (freezer, box, well)
    - Status
  - [x] Export reports to CSV format (separate file for each sample type)
  - [x] Summary statistics and distribution analysis

### High Priority
- [ ] **Report Enhancements**
  - [ ] Add filtering by date range, sample type, status
  - [ ] Add Excel export option (in addition to CSV)
  - [ ] Create web interface for report generation
  - [ ] Schedule automated daily/weekly reports

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Data Validation**
  - [ ] Verify all parent-child relationships are correct
  - [ ] Check for orphaned samples
  - [ ] Validate all barcodes are unique
  - [ ] Ensure all required fields are populated

- [ ] **UI Enhancements**
  - [ ] Display sample_id prominently in admin interface
  - [ ] Add sample ID to list views and search
  - [ ] Create sample hierarchy visualization
  - [ ] Add bulk sample creation interface

- [ ] **Reporting Dashboard**
  - [ ] Sample count by type and date
  - [ ] Storage location utilization
  - [ ] Sample processing pipeline status
  - [ ] Quality metrics (if applicable)

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Data Import/Export**
  - [ ] Bulk import from CSV/Excel
  - [ ] Template generation for imports
  - [ ] Validation before import
  - [ ] Export with full hierarchy

- [ ] **API Development**
  - [ ] RESTful API for sample queries
  - [ ] Barcode scanning integration
  - [ ] External system integration

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] User manual for sample management
  - [ ] API documentation
  - [ ] Workflow diagrams
  - [ ] Best practices guide

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

1. **Automated Workflows**
   - Sample processing pipelines
   - Automated status updates
   - Notification system for sample events

2. **Advanced Search**
   - Full-text search across all fields
   - Complex query builder
   - Saved search queries

3. **Quality Control**
   - QC metrics tracking
   - Automated QC checks
   - QC report generation

4. **Integration Features**
   - LIMS integration
   - Instrument data import
   - External database sync
