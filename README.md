## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mgml_sampledb.git
   cd mgml_sampledb
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   sudo apt-get install python3-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev build-essential pkg-config
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:
   ```
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   DEBUG=True
   ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
   
   DB_NAME=mgml_sampledb
   DB_USER=your_db_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=3306
   ```

5. Run migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Create a superuser:
   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. Set up user groups and permissions:
   ```
   python manage.py setup_groups
   ```
   This creates the following groups:
   - **Sample Collectors**: For nurses/collection staff
   - **Viewers**: Read-only access
   - **Technicians**: Standard lab users
   - **Lab Managers**: Full administrative access

8. Run the development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

9. Access the application at http://localhost:8000

> **ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip**: After initial setup, see `VIRTUAL_ENVIRONMENT_GUIDE.md` for convenient ways to work with the project, including the `mgml` alias that combines `cd` and virtual environment activation!

## Usage

### For Sample Collection Staff
1. Access the collection portal at `/collection/` or via the home page

## Management Commands

### Import Legacy Samples
Import historical samples from CSV files:
```bash
python manage.py import_legacy_samples <csv_file> [options]
```

**Options**:
- `--dry-run`: Preview import without making changes
- `--skip-intermediates`: Skip creating intermediate aliquots/extracts
- `--username <username>`: Specify user for audit trail (default: admin)

**CSV Format**:
The import system expects a CSV file with the following columns:
- **Required**: `subject_id`, `collection_date`
- **Optional**: `legacy_sequence_filename`, `project_name`, `investigator`, `patient_type`, `study_id`, `sample_source`, `isolate_source`, `barcode`, `n_index`, `s_index`, `library_type`, `sequencing_date`, `sequencing_platform`, `notes`, `data_file_location`

See `import_template.csv` for a complete example.

**Import Behavior**:
- Creates full sample hierarchy: Parent Sample â†’ Aliquot â†’ Extract â†’ Sequence Library
- Auto-generates barcodes with suffixes (_CR, _AL, _EX, _SL) if not provided
- Preserves original sequence filenames for metadata crosswalk
- Marks imported samples with status='ARCHIVED'
- Validates data and reports errors before importing

### Other Management Commands
```bash
# Set up user groups and permissions
python manage.py setup_groups

# Run database migrations
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create admin user
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Run tests
python manage.py test sampletracking.tests
```
